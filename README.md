# SocialNetwork

I created a mock social network to practice ReactJS, Flux, and Redux. I decided to use Redux as the framework for this project.

# TO USE

* Since I switched to a MERN stack and my project is still in development, you must have MongoDB installed to create a mongo database. I included a script to initialize the database: scripts/init.mongo.sh. I also took out Webpack and used Gulp for now, because I still need to learn Webpack more in depth.

```
// in SocialNetwork/

npm install
./scripts/init.mongo.sh
gulp bundle
node server-hook.js
```

Server is now running on localhost:3000

I have not styled the UI yet since styling is not the main focus of this project.

At its current state, the social network was centered around the user; the user's friends, wall, and other people are displayed on the home page. The user can post on his/her own wall and add/remove friends. I was adding functionality for viewing the user's friends' profiles, however I encountered a design problem. Since I centered the application around the user, I could not effectively scale the components to render other people's profiles. Before I move on with the project, I am going to fix the design to accompany any type of user by referencing an item from the store that stores the current profile ID to view. This will allow for differentiation between the user, friends, and other people when viewing profiles.

I restructured the design so that it was not centered around the user. I instead indexed all the accounts and their data in the store and created a 'currentId' store element to hold the current profile to view. This made navigation easier by allowing any profile id to be pushed onto the browserHistory. This allowed the profile's data to be generated dynamically through the components. This creates the illusion that each profile has its own page. The data is currently generated locally rather than being stored in a database. I will implement a database at a later time.

Next I will be adding unique functionality for the user. I will be changing how components render on a certain account's page depending on whether or not the user is his/her friend. I am not sure what else I will be implementing in this section.

# 07/07/2016

I changed the components to render based on the user's perspective. The user is allowed to view the walls and friend lists of his/her friends. The user can view the profile of someone that is not on their friends list, however they cannot see that person's wall or friend list. 'People You May Know' is only displayed on the user's home page. The user can only remove his/her own friends and wall posts. 

Next I will be learning the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack and will be trying to transfer my application to use it. I will be doing this so that my data could persist in a database. At a later time, I hope to store the user as an account the client himself creates (with a username and password).

# 07/12/2016

I learned the basics of the MERN stack and transferred my project to the stack. The state of the project is essentially where it was before except that data is now persisted and the application is served to the client from the server. The code had to be modified a good amount, although the logic stayed pretty much the same, so check the diffs. I created a script to initiate a mongodb (scripts/init.mongo.sh). The database a collection of objects that hold information for each profile. I also created an additional collection that holds all the registered ids and their associated names. I manipulate the database using axios promises. 

I have not implemented server side routing yet, so you can only access the application from localhost:3000/ .. I intend to do server side routing next. I also hope to create a simple log in system (not with authentication) so that the client can use different accounts that are registered with the system or create a new account. Later I hope to create interactivity between two users, such as instant messaging, using sockets.

I promise I'll style it one day :D!

I realized that transferring this project to include server side rendering isomporphically/universally would be too difficult for me right now. I would have to load some data initially on the server, but my actions are not currently suited to do so. My goal for this project was to practice React and I believe I learned a lot from it, so I am going to end the project here. I created a login page with an option for the user to create an account. I also added log out features. 

Since I now understand the basic of the MERN stack and how universal server side rendering is done, I will be able to lay a better foundation for my next project. 

For my next project, I want to learn how to use sockets to make my application be real time. I might learn AngularJS and create an application based on the MEAN stack. I also want to render and route server side.
